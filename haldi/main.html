    <h2>•	What attracted you to Haldi and this role? </h2>
    <p>
        I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I am actively looking for software engineering roles for new grads.
    I got attracted to Haldi specially because of the name which means turmeric to Indian people and by seeing how two women founded
    Haldi. Every women is interested in getting a great skincare routine, and for me ,a women in tech getting a skincare and then working for the brand
    would be a great opportunity to start my career in.

    <h2>•	Tell us about a software project that you worked on -- What was the problem you were trying to solve? What did you build?
        What was an issue or challenge you ran into along the way and how did you solve it?</h2>
        <p>
        One of my recent project that I worked is from my Software Engineering coursework. We build a Java Pong Application/Game
        using Java, Object-Oriented Programming and JavaFx. It was a collaborative project of 25 students . We had a basic pong game, and then
        each student had their own better and modified version of the game. My version of the game included adding some background music,
        making the UI better , changing speed of the puck and some other features. The only challenge was at that time I was new to Java
        Programming, so I had to get comfortable in Java in order to complete the application. But, overall I gained a really great experience of
        JUnit testing and Object-Oriented Programming.

         <h2>•	What inspired you to become a software engineer?</h2>
         <p>
         During my last year of high school back in India when I took my first computer course and when I learnt my first programming language (C++)
         , I was very fascinated by technology and computers. I used to assit my computer professor during the lab times and that was when my passion
         for technology and inspiration to become a Software Engineer came from.

    <h2>•	We're an early stage startup with a small engineering team, which means that every engineer has a lot of opportunity to
        learn and take ownership. Give an example from school or your past experience where you've demonstrated initiative.</h2>
        <p>
        I recently completed a coursework in Computer Networks, in which students had to team up and prepare a presentation about
        different topics in the tech industry. I took the initiative of coming up with Cloud Computing as our topic of my team's research and
        then spent a couple of days gathering resources and discussing it with my teammates. I took the initiative of presenting and sharing our
        research with the class and our Professor.
